The Level end modal shows up on the [[Gameplay screen design]] at the end of (most) game levels. It shows:

- Results rating (star rating) or lose message if the player wasn't able to complete the level
- Level stats:
	- if died: Killed by (enemy)
	- if won: rocks mined, monsters squashed, gems collected
- Options:
	- Retry (if lost) or replay (if complete))
	- Back to Basecamp
	- Next level (if complete)
